		Hana is a small town located on the <b>east side of Maui</b>. It is home to some of the
		<a href="http://xfinity.comcast.net/slideshow/news-bestbeaches/7/" target="_blank" class="linked">
			world’s most beautiful beaches</a>,
		breath taking waterfalls, and majestic coastlines. From Kahului airport it is about a 50 mile drive along the
		winding coastline. Along the way you can enjoy hiking trails, beautiful overlooks, and incredible waterfalls.
	</p>

	<p>
		Hana town is limited when it comes to night life and dining options. There is one gas station and two small
		stores (<b>closes at 7:30 PM</b>). If you are staying for several nights, we recommend buying groceries in
		Kahului
		before driving to Hana. Travaasa Hotel has a bar and restaurant, although it is a bit pricey, and so does
		the Hana Ranch Restaurant (also pricey). There are a several locally owned eateries and lunch
		wagons around town. A local favorite is
		<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/thai-food-by-pranee-hana" target="_blank" class="linked" title="view Pranee's on Yelp">Pranee's</a>,
		which has excellent Thai food. Checkout

			on Yelp</a>
		for a list of popular activities and food options.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are a variety of outdoor activities, some of which we’ve listed below. It is nice to have a couple of
		days to
		spend in Hana because it is a long trip out here. That way you have some time to just relax and explore this
		side of
		the island.
